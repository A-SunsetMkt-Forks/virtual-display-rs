# Virtual Display Driver

[![Build App](https://github.com/MolotovCherry/virtual-display-rs/actions/workflows/build-app.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/MolotovCherry/virtual-display-rs/actions/workflows/build-app.yml) [![Build Driver](https://github.com/MolotovCherry/virtual-display-rs/actions/workflows/build-driver.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/MolotovCherry/virtual-display-rs/actions/workflows/build-driver.yml) [![GitHub release (with filter)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/MolotovCherry/virtual-display-rs)](https://github.com/MolotovCherry/virtual-display-rs/releases)

This is a Windows driver made in Rust which creates a virtual desktop.

It has many uses, such as:
- A private virtual desktop for VR use
- For remote desktops
- Getting a higher resolution (or higher refresh rate) display when you don't have a physical one on-hand (though note you can only use it in software/VR)
- Other uses? Let me know!

Support: Windows 10 x64 +

## Features
- Multiple monitors (up to 10)
- Multiple resolutions per monitor
- Multiple refresh rates per resolution
- App to configure them all, disable all/individual monitors

# How to install
- Go to the [releases](https://github.com/MolotovCherry/virtual-display-rs/releases) section for the latest driver.
- Download (you may receive a warning, just press accept)
- Install certificate (see below section)
- Open `Device Manager`
- - Click on any item
  - Click on `Action` menu item -> `Add legacy hardware` -> `Next`
  - Click `Install the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced)`
  - Click `Next` (`Show All Devices` will be selected)
  - Click `Have Disk`
  - Browse to the location of the folder, press `Ok`, and keep clicking the `Next` buttons

### Installing the certificate
The certificate needs installation for Windows to accept the driver
- In your downloaded zip, double click on the file `DriverCertificate.cer`
- A window will popup with a `Install Certificate` button (click it)
- Select `Local Machine`
- Select `Place All Certificates in the following store`, click `Browse` and select `Trusted Root Certification Authorities`
- Cick `Next` and `Finish`

# Disabling the display(s)
- Open the app, and either check the global "enabled" switch to turn all monitors off, or click an individual switch next to the monitor in the list

# Using the app
- All settings made in the app are persisted for the app and driver config
- If you change the port, a manual driver restart is required for it to listen on the new port

Disabling/enabling monitors:
- In the main window, click the switch at the top to disable all monitors, or the switch beside an individual monitor to disable only that one
- You can do the same thing to re-enable any

Configuring:
- Give your monitor a name (if you want)
- After clicking the "+" button to add a new monitor, click on the row to open the settings.
- You can also click the red "-" to delete a monitor
- Click the "+" button at the bottom to add an initial resolution/refresh rate. You can add more refresh rates for that particular resolution in the main monitor settings window refresh rate dropdown
- Press SAVE when you are done. Any entry with `*` before it will NOT be saved.
- If you don't want to save, press the "Clear" button, and all your pending changes will be cleared
- You can press the red "-" button next to a resolution or refresh rate to delete those specifically. Warning!! If you delete all monitor modes, the monitor will be disconnected from the system
- If you add any resolutions/refresh rates and press save, the monitor changes will NOT show up on your system initially. If you just setup your monitor for the first time, enable the monitor in the main window. If you configured an existing monitor, you NEED to disable and re-enable the monitor manually for it to update.

The save button in the main window forcefully saves any changes. You DO NOT need to press this to make your settings get saved. Settings are automatically saved when the application is closed.

# Ok, I set it up, but what then?
You can change your monitors, resolutions, and refresh rates in Windows itself just like you would any other monitor ðŸ˜ƒ

# Updating
- Open `Device Manager`
- Under the `Display` section, find the `Virtual Display` driver and double click
- Click the `Driver` tab and the `Update Driver` button
- Click `Browse my computer for drivers`, browse for the right location, and click `Next`

# How to build
- Download and install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (use the 2022 edition)
- Select and install the `Desktop development with C++` workload as well as Windows SDK
- Install the [WDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk)
- Install [`cargo-make`](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) if you don't have it
- You can build it with `cargo make -p dev build` (debug) or `cargo make -p prod build` (release)
- ... Or, fork my project and build it with github actions

### Debugging
To see panic messages and other information, download [DebugViewPP](https://github.com/CobaltFusion/DebugViewPP), run it, click on `Log`->`Capture Global Win32` (note, this requires DebugViewPP be run with admin permissions)

# Extra notes
If you enabled while everything has been booted for awhile, some applications may not be able to see the virtual monitor. You can fix this by rebooting while having it enabled (or enable it quickly after you boot up). This seems to be an issue with Windows itself, but I do not know why. It has affected every single virtual monitor driver I have ever tried. If anyone does know, please feel free to share information ðŸ˜ƒ
